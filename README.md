## Features
My objective for this project is to create a social media niche website for astrophiles. So that, the people who are interested in space can network and share their opinion and discuss on their favourite topics related to space. It will include the following four major Features: 

* Sign Up - New users can Sign up by clicking on the signup button at the top-right corner. They need to provide username, e-mail address and password. Password needs to be typed twice. 
* Log In - Users can log in to the website by providing their username and password the page will be updated with their posts and groups. 
* Groups - Users can create and join groups of their interests. After joining a group users can post their opinion in the groups and read other’s posts.
* Post - This button will redirect the users to a posting page from where they can post anything to the any group they joined or created. 
Django provides a view component which reads the input from user interface and makes corresponding changes in the database. 


## Usage example
Use this site to post your opinion in groups to share it with other people having similar interest.
